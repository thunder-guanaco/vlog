1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:01,930
Good morning!

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,350
Here we are to try this little thing,
Disc claw

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,290
20â‚¬ has cost, but
it's worth it.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,250
We're going to try to rescue a disc that Fede
has lost today

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,820
It's there, a few meters from here.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,480
So, let's see how the thing works.

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,580
Yoo-hoo!

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,220
He's caught fish!

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,520
Here's the guy!

10
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,810
Fede's skeeter
Is cool, isn't it?

11
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,870
Three, four shots. How much did I throw?

12
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,870
Na!

13
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,860
Come on, again!

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,020
So: Disc claw
twenty euros.

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,010
You have to have a little bit of skill on the floor,
but

16
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,370
It's okay, I mean.

17
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,080
I recommend it

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,430
And Fede too, who's lost two discs.

19
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,420
And he's got them back.
Well, then..

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,500
See you next time!
