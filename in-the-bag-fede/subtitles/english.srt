1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,050
Helo, I am Federico, and that is what I have brought
in my bag for the torunament here,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,919
in Asturias, the Open de España.

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:12,780
Starting with 3 putters, P2, P-Line,
soft edition, I would like to tell you that they are really soft,

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,710
they give you a lot of grip, and, of course,
for conditions like the ones we have today

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,120
that are a bit rainy, you have 
a good grip, which is

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,780
really good.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,490
A really good disc.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,300
I buy them in pink because you can easily see them.
You throw them, you see them.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,469
Also, I brought a first edition of a
P3X in S-Line.

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,640
This disc is stable.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
It will come back.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,940
It can be tyrannical and va.
a volver, va a luchar.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,920
By the way, it is a tiras with a great deal of anhyzer.
It is not going to be enough, but it is good.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,489
It is a very good disco for salidas, for salidas, for
We are committed to rights and obligations.

15
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,460
and the good thing is that it can be lured against the vengeance.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,469
En alguna ocasión donde tenga mucho viento
I would also like to make use of it for the following reasons

17
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,979
The Commission will continue to take account of the need for and against this.

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,890
I would like to put the final stop to the fact that it is one of the following
Aviar.

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,740
I believe that the CAP is KC-Pro, but this is not the case.
Segments.

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,800
Loredo por 2€ a Manolo y él lo lo
I have compliment, including EUR 2 for us.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,280
entrenador en Alemagna y éste hombre lo había
recibido del campeón de Alemagna, osea, el

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,280
The putter vuela bien.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,780
There is no point in saying that this is a good thing.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,540
It has a history and a good history.

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,650
This is the disco that you are talking about all of these.
situations where there is no such thing as that, this is me

26
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,770
salva la vida.

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,680
Now it is only the distance between the media.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,720
I would like to thank you for your distant discussions.

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,540
Si, correcto.

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,360
From the beginning, it is more difficult and more difficult to achieve,
tengo un Matrix de MVP.

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,360
This is what I have complimented, namely, good governance, manoeuvre and
Io pertenecemos al club de disc golf de Puerta

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,880
Doñana también, and I have complimented all of them,
with the escudo of the club.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,180
The Matrix, that is the right.

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,400
This can be tackled with all of the following resources
Worldwide, this is a real right.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,750
This is not going to be the case.

36
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,300
Luego tengo un Shark3.

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,620
The Shark3 is a disco bastante neutro.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,560
It is a manoeuvre for me to cumpleños
the año pasado.

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,959
A very good disco, a very good champion.

40
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,459
I would like to thank the MD4, in violet, also one of the following
regalo de Manolo.

41
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,459
This means that the recta línea is maintained and includes the following
I can tell you that there is no room for manoeuvre.

42
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,060
and I have a number of very good bonuses.

43
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,409
You can go against it,
in a dual situation, to be in a lío.

44
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:47,670
También lo puede derechas, vuela
derechito y vuelve.

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,700
I think it is more manageable, it is the best.
it is more manageable that I believe in my little creed

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,519
I believe that this is a Justice.

47
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,760
This is not dear to me.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,420
This is what I think is what it is all about.
1, osea, this is not a vuela.

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,420
This is a tiras y se cae.


50
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,840
That, I have in metal flake, also rosita,
to find him.

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:15,099
I bought it from Ville in the pro-shop of the
discgolfpark of Málaga and this I use it on

52
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:20,041
all for right-wing approaches, because
no matter what the situation, the time, what

53
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,230
be, you know you're throwing this away with all
and it's gonna come back.

54
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,230
This is gonna do the curve.

55
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,230
This isn't going away.

56
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,950
And the truth is, too, for some
curve with a skip that you have to do is

57
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,950
great.

58
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,129
Then I move on to the fairway drivers.

59
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:41,000
I have an FD2 that my friend painted for me.
Marcel.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,160
Very cool record, he painted it for me.

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,219
I use this mostly for right-hand drives.
or left and for distant approaches,

62
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,150
when it's 60 or 70 meters, I already use this.

63
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,329
Then I'll take the Underworld.

64
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:00,890
That this is to make shots like this a little bit
as a "trick."

65
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,650
That one says: "I throw it like this" and the disc is
gets up and goes to the right.

66
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,900
I'm throwing it right out a lot.
so down and up and holds me.

67
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,900
the whole line.

68
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,109
If I have to do a rollerblade, this record.

69
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,689
Very very very versatile.

70
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:22,680
And then it's over to... I call it a fairway driver.
but they're there.

71
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,080
Of value (velocity) nine.

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,310
I've got two Getaways.

73
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,150
One of Danny Lindahl's and one of BioFuzion's.

74
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,990
The Getaway are discs that allow you to put
any line.

75
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,760
You put it in anhyzer and it's gonna keep the
anhyzer and he's gonna come back a little bit.

76
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,560
If he wants to do a roller coaster, so does he.

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,430
If you want to pull to the right, too.

78
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,770
It's a very versatile album, fights the wind..
I recommend it.

79
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,780
Try it, if you can try it, give it a try.
Keep an eye on this.

80
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,590
Then I have a Thunderbird in Metal flake.
that my sister has given it to me for these

81
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,590
Christmas.

82
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,530
And to the right he's got a mind-blowing flight.

83
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,590
Very very very straight and at the end it does a little bit
of fade.

84
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,590
That's great. That's great.

85
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,980
It's really cool, too.

86
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,889
What have I got here?

87
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:15,090
Then we moved on to something bigger.

88
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,330
I'm carrying the first record I ever bought myself, personally,
his name is Tietäjä, I think I pronounce it

89
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,979
more or less well, but if not already some Finnish
he'll tell me it's wrong.

90
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:27,190
It's the Sorcerer, or "sorcerer."

91
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,770
In 170 grams.

92
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,770
This is tournament plastic.

93
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:37,370
Truth is, it's a little unstable, but
Not much. That means I can.

94
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,090
let go with a little hyzer and it's going to get
right, he's gonna do a little bit of a curve.

95
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,270
to the right and he's gonna come back.

96
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,490
And also, for right-wing shots, you can
to make a tunnel of 80 meters, straight straight straight

97
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,490
straight.

98
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,490
A great album!

99
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,810
I've used it since day one and every time.
I'm getting more fond of him.

100
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:05,949
Then we moved on to something more caliber, which
are two Destroyers.

101
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,949
Orange and blue.

102
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,070
I traded the blue one to Manolo for another one.
disk.

103
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:17,439
The truth is, they're a little different,
the blue is very stable, the orange is more

104
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,439
neutral.

105
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,050
That's two Destroyers, with Star plastic.

106
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,550
That, I use for everything, right, left,
up, down...

107
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,849
A very good record, I think anyone
who can have it in his suitcase would have it,

108
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:29,849
don't you?

109
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:33,330
I always buy them in different colors because
It's silly, but that's the way it is when you go.

110
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,500
to get out of your suitcase you don't have to look at which one
is which one.

111
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I know blue is the most stable,
I know that orange is more neutral and I

112
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,960
I just bought a red one that I hope will be
a little more unstable, so always buying

113
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
by colors.

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,560
Then I have...

115
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Whoo!

116
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,050
I forgot this one!

117
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,080
It's a PD2.

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,210
The truth is, it's not as stable as a
PD2 any.

119
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,800
PD2s tend to go a lot to the left, but
this holds the line and then falls.

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,010
I use it from the right to make skips, from the right to the left.
make an anhyzer, an "S", and that...

121
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:18,449
I don't throw it backwards much, but right.
a lot.

122
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:24,370
And then I have two records that I really like,
that they are: The World.

123
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,449
It's a stable disk, it's almost like the PD2,
but the cool thing about this is that it's got plastic.

124
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,449
Elasto.

125
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:37,879
Elasto is a plastic that is quite soft,
quite moldable and no longer produce it, that is,

126
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,650
that if anyone wants to take this plastic,
run to the stores.

127
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:49,770
For cold conditions, conditions of
rain, conditions thus more adverse, is

128
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,370
This type of plastic is highly recommended.

129
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,440
It doesn't get that firm.

130
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,610
And he's got a good grip.

131
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,599
I think it's almost like Innova's G-Star.

132
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,719
And then the last one in my suitcase.
is an album that I was given in the "players

133
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:11,930
pack" of the tournament in October in Mijas, which
is a queen, or, as it says here, "Emanta."

134
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,270
Here you go.

135
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,209
This disk is unstable and has a lot
of glide.

136
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,209
He always comes back.

137
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:18,210
That's a very important thing to me.

138
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:24,639
I can pull it from the right and with this I'll make you
100 meters with the whole curve.

139
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,259
And the truth is that it helps me a lot, because I
I don't have much strength and it's a record that will

140
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,539
provides that versatility one would want
to have.

141
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,339
And nothing, that's what I've brought here and even
next time!
