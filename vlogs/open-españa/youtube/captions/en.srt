1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,120
Well, second day.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,440
Plan for today: we're going to train,
to the same discgolf park again.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,969
They already said when we started tomorrow, I
I start at 11:30AM and you start at...

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,230
At 10:38, I think, we start every 12 minutes,
which is really cool because that means

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,770
that we're not going to accumulate in any hole
in which the disks roll a lot, and that is

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,060
Something to appreciate, that's cool.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,430
We're going to buy food for disc golf now.
i.e., water.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,660
And I'll see you later.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,680
We've finished training for tomorrow.
and we played pretty badly for what we wanted to have played.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,780
The coolest thing about this field is that, you've got
that to control that when falling, the disk is not

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,180
Fuck it.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,900
Well, and we're already leaving the park and
Now we're going to lunch.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,519
And Manolo said, "Let's get some cider!

14
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:47,949
Yeah, man, yeah, since we're in Asturias.
You drink cider, man.

15
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:52,559
Cider for breakfast, cider for lunch,
cidra for dinner, cidra and inside the colacao..

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,719
Well, I'll see you at the cidrería!

17
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,930
Well, Manolo likes the cidrería so much.
who took one and bought one.

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,019
Are we gonna eat here, man?

19
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,749
First day of competition.

20
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:04,400
We have an impressive fog.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,480
And good Fede. How motivated are you?

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Motivated, a lot.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
My throat hurts.

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm fine. Let's see what comes out, I'll go.
positive, that is, I don't go with a "go" desto

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
to win" but...

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
What do you mean, no?

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,060
Man, I mean, you can fool yourself,
but..

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,280
Well, if you're fooling yourself enough
You may win!

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,500
You can fool yourself if you want to,
but there are people I've already seen with a rating

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,620
really high.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,400
Well, we finished the round today.

32
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,960
We played... you say it.

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,180
Mehhhh
He has played "Mehhh" I wish I had

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,380
played that badly!

35
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,530
I mean, I've played even worse.

36
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,000
Nothing worked out, it was horrible today.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,170
The baskets spit out my putts, three
or four times.

38
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,950
I hit every tree that exists.

39
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,630
A fucking piece of shit what I've done!

40
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,630
And you, Manolo, what's up?

41
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,640
This really pissed me off, man,
because I'm starting: Bogey, birdie, bogey, bogey...

42
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
and I was like...

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
What are you doing? What are you doing?

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,740
So,  we are going to eat, that it is already
the time.

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,340
Tomorrow we will surely play more
early.

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,180
The worse you play, the earlier you play.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm going to be the first to go...

48
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,980
Bye-bye!

49
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,900
We just got back from eating and drinking
a lot and it's 00:30 AM and

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,000
tomorrow we have to get up very early
because we've played really bad.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,290
Well, at least Fede's been playing really bad.
and I've played bad, well, half bad.

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,290
I play...

53
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,470
I think Fede has to start playing
at 10:20 a.m. and I at 11 a.m..

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,470
is very ugly.

55
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,020
Conclusion: It is necessary to play better or to play in
Pro (Open), the Pro starts at 12 o'clock

56
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,020
in the morning..

57
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,180
It's true that it costs 20€ more to sign up
to Pro, but hey, what you're taking from it is:

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,570
"I don't have to sleep 7-5 hours, maybe 6.
hours..."

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,160
But what are you talking about, man, if it's the
00:30!

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
Come on, okay, I'm going to sleep 8 hours...

61
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,980
If we can get up at 8:30 a.m. and throw away
up and we still have time...

62
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,540
Well, let's go to sleep!

63
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,600
Good morning!

64
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,560
Good morning!

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,900
Second day of tournament, today we are going to have to
to overcome the 10-15-20 places...

66
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,910
At least...

67
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,620
That's my goal: 10 shots down!

68
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,900
What about you?

69
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,260
My thing is that yesterday I had 10 bogeys.

70
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,540
Not triple bogeys like Fede!

71
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,790
No, not me man, me all bogeys, bogey,
bogey, bogey..

72
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,180
And two birdies, but well...

73
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,959
With a 15-meter putt that's on "Television
Española"(TVE).

74
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,770
It's true, Manolo is on TVE!

75
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,819
"This is a sport for all ages
and cheap, the price of a record is around

76
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,100
12€.."

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,460
Well, after today's round I can already
to say goodbye to the tournament.

78
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,660
Completely.

79
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,780
So: See you later!

80
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,780
I played a +8 yesterday and I said, "I can...
to improve, I can improve."

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
I got a +20 today.

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,600
I took it on the 8th hole after shooting.
against the two trees, after I put myself

83
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,720
in O.B. twice and pass the mando,
I got a 10.

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,130
I mean, a +6 there.

85
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,130
PUM!

86
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,130
all over my face.

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,160
And three holes later I get a +4.

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,630
Suddenly a +10 and I am like "bye bye!".

89
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,730
From there..

90
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,480
It was a +20, that is..

91
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,720
I have to say one thing:
I started the round and said: "I am

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,780
tired."

93
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,520
We came here, just to get there: play.

94
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,250
The next day play and then start the
tournament, and I started the round today tired.

95
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,370
So So yeah..

96
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,949
Well, Manolo and I just got a cachopo...

97
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:41,949
It is a beast.

98
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,050
This is a disc next to the cachopo.

99
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,150
The cachopo is bigger than a disk.

100
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,320
I don't put it high because it's full
of shit.

101
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,560
Yes, please, I want to eat it.

102
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,540
Let's eat!

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Good morning.

104
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,530
I played better yesterday.

105
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,610
The result has not been so good, because
I missed the putts, too low or too high.

106
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,810
I've improved nothing more than four shots and nothing,
we're coming.

107
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,710
Today is the worst day of all we've ever had.
you've had here.

108
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,210
If you can see there are clouds everywhere,
the field is wet, it rained at night,

109
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,800
there's wind, they've predicted rain during
the round..

110
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,550
Well, we're done playing the Open.
of Spain and after this I believe that

111
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,240
the best thing is going to be to go home because this
is depressing.

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,259
If yesterday I had the 10 and the 7, today I got
a nine...

113
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,479
I mean, roll down four times and say:
Dude, fuck it all!

114
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,180
I get as learning from this tournament:
Point number 1: You have to learn to shoot

115
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,990
measuring the angle where they're going to fall.

116
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,199
Point number 2:
Throw 300 meters at that angle.

117
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,970
Dude, wait a minute!

118
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,330
Point number 2: We have to improve our
physical condition.

119
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,310
I've played 5 days in a row disc golf.

120
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,300
On Saturday, yesterday, I was tired

121
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,962
I've taken shots today that I say: Dude, I could
to go much further, which I know, but

122
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:08,100
is that I'm busted.

123
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,820
Practice and knowing the park yes, but to play
Five days in a row, I don't think it's necessary.

124
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,220
At least from my point of view.

125
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,660
I played like shit.

126
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,400
That's it. That's it.

127
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,880
And there's nothing to say.

128
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,340
Let's practice.

129
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,510
And now that we're done playing.
we've finished everything and we're super blown up,

130
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,030
super tired and a little dissatisfied with
what we've done.

131
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,660
You know what we're gonna do?

132
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,620
Hole one of the "winter camp".

133
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,250
Let's go!

134
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,700
Manu has brought us here and we are going to play
one round and we're gonna give it all up right now.

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,600
We're going home now.

136
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,080
Yeah, let's go.

137
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
It's over now.

138
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,440
Yes, please, let's go home and sleep.

139
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,880
Me, too. I think it's a good idea to leave now.
so nothing. See you later!
