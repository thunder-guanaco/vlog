00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,210
6 in the morning, today Manolo and I have the
first tournament of the German Tour, in Gillbach.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:16,260
And I woke up early, and, because
my coffe machine is broken, I don't have any coffee.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,250
I had to leave early in the morning,
Look how dark it is! To get coffee.

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,920
I really want to play and get rid of those bad 
sensations of the tournament in Oviedo, so

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,780
I'll tell you more later.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,420
Good morning! Well here we are in the small field

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,280
in Neuss Beckhofen. And it's a small field
of 9 holes and apparently we are going to play a

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,299
18 holes tournament, and what they've done is 
to have 18 different exits for the 9 holes,

9
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,010
that is, each hole has 2 exits, let's say, and
there's like two fields. One that is field A

10
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,299
and another that is field B. Then each one
has 9 different holes. And that's it.

11
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:02,039
We're gonna warm up a little bit. It is already
time for it. I have had a 1:30 hour trip

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:10,090
in a car, which is a good thing..
And.. warm up. Let's go!

13
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,520
It's our turn to start and get onto this. 
Let's rock it.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,200
I haven't done a putt yet, but
Let's go, let's go.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,480
As we are in carnivals, people

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,360
has come dressed to play, super cool. Look,
there's a dragon he's going to throw now.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,320
Oy, oy oy oy...!

18
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,920
Uyyyyyy..

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,040
And here we have the Maja bee, which says
Hey! Hey!

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:06,100
We just finished the first round, two.
times the layout A. I've played a -2 and a -1.

21
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:13,000
and I found out half a minute ago that I've
taken four penalty points for

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,499
writing the wrong result on the paper. So now
I am on +1, when I had a -3 on the first round.

23
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:25,269
And how about you, Manolo?
Well, in the first round I played a -3,

24
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,180
which was the second best score of
the first round. I mean, me, super happy.

25
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,209
Super cool. The second round started and I said:
I know the course! Let's go!

26
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:40,700
I have to do this, boom boom... and I got a +3... that
is the second worst score of the second

27
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:48,450
round, I mean, I'm out of my mind. All in all
nothing, that's what you get for knowing the field. It is necessary

28
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,980
to play without knowing it. The course is not difficult,
the baskets all he's got is that they're

29
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,159
close to the OB or trees, like this one, that
is around things like for example

30
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:07,150
a piece of tree there with a lot of
twigs, that's good, because it makes the course

31
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,189
a bit harder, but it's got its little thing.
Let's see, the field, if you come and play to

32
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:19,232
make the shots that need to be made, you can
get out of here with a -6 of the 9 holes

33
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:25,239
you can do the -6 perfectly. And you stay
so relaxed, i.e.... This is no big deal.

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,790
Well, yes... They're calling us, we're leaving!
We're going to the second round, see you later!

35
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,320
We just finished round two and

36
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:43,080
I think it's been a little more difficult
than the first layout. I've played par. And you

37
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,519
Manolo?
In total I have played -1.

38
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,450
I liked the layout, I liked it more,
because he had more shots like 100-meter long to the

39
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,639
right, or things like that, it was beautiful.
I think the baskets could be a

40
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,400
a little farther away from things, because the
end was all: yes, 100 meters, I had

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,629
the distance, but if you don't give hit the right spot
then you get a shitty putt and

42
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,069
I didn't put them in. I mean, I haven't had
birdies for not being able to do the putts.

43
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,629
To me what I did not like of this field

44
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:16,350
is that they had here 9 holes with
their 9 exits, all right, and then they've taken

45
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,850
and they've said, well, we'll put some more
Nine exits, and that's how we make an 18-field, right?

46
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,690
The idea itself, perfect. Now, the implementation...
It has left a lot to be desired. Yes, in other words, you're going

47
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,690
from hole 5 to hole 6 and you cross through the
7, and you... Dude!....

48
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,010
And people waiting, I don't know... there's been like
two or three holes that have crossed the holes

49
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,850
and... no, no, not really. Let's see, no,
The thing is, we could have played a lot

50
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,550
better. This course you can play it perfectly
of the 9 holes, you could have played...

51
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,780
Minus two, minus three perfectly...
Minus two, minus three... and minus five too,

52
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,310
I mean, it's not like you say it's hard, but
I don't know...

53
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,172
But it has to be done.
So, let's see if the next time

54
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,750
we do and..
But it's been cool, we've played

55
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,670
a new course. It is true, a new course.
It's super far away from our house.

56
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,410
I'll never come here again in my life,
unless there's a tournament... but well...

57
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,030
See you next time! See you later!
