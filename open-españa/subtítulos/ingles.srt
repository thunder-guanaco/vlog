1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,120
Well, second day.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,440
Plan for today: we're going to train,
to the same field again.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,969
They already said when we started tomorrow, I
I start at 11:30AM and you start at...

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,230
At 10:38, I think, we leave every 12 minutes,
which is really cool because that means

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,770
that we're not going to accumulate in any hole
in which the disks roll a lot, and that is

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,060
He's very appreciative, he's cool.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,430
We're going to buy consignments for the disc now.
golf, i.e., water.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,660
And I'll see you later.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,680
We've finished training for tomorrow.
and we played pretty badly for what we wanted to have played.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,780
The coolest thing about this field is that, you've got
that to control that when falling, the disk is not

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,180
Fuck it.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,900
Well, and we're already leaving the park and
Now we're going to lunch.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,519
And Manolo said, "Let's get some cider!

14
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:47,949
Yeah, man, yeah, since we're in Asturias.
You drink cider, man.

15
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:52,559
Cider for breakfast, cider for lunch,
cidra for dinner, cidra and inside the colacao..

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,719
Well, I'll see you at the cidrería!

17
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,930
Well, Manolo likes the cidrería so much.
who took one and bought one.

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,019
Are we gonna eat here, man?

19
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,749
First day of competition.

20
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:04,400
We have an impressive fog.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,480
And good Fede. How motivated are you?

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Motivated, a lot.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
My throat hurts.

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm fine. Let's see what comes out, I'll go.
positive, that is, I don't go with a "go" desto

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
to win" but...

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
What do you mean, no?

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,060
Man, I mean, you can fool yourself,
but..

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,280
Well, if you're fooling yourself anyway.
You win!

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,500
You can fool yourself if you want to,
but there are people I've already seen with a rating.

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,620
of "and picomil."

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,400
Well, we finished the round today.

32
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,960
We played... you say it.

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,180
Mehhhh
He has played "Mehhh" I wish I had

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,380
played that badly!

35
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,530
I mean, I've played worse.

36
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,000
Nothing came out, it was horrible today.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,170
The baskets spit out my putts, three.
or four times.

38
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,950
I've beaten every tree I've ever seen.
and for having.

39
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,630
A fucking piece of shit what I've done!

40
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,630
And you, Manolo, what's up?

41
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,640
He's really given me all the courage, man,
because I'm starting: Bogey, birdie, bogey, bogey...

42
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
and your uncle...

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
What are you doing? What are you doing?

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,740
That nothing, that we are going to eat, that it is already
the time.

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,340
Tomorrow we will surely play more
early.

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,180
The meaner you get, the earlier you play.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm going to be the first to go...

48
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,980
Bye-bye!

49
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,900
We just got back from eating and drinking
it's not written and it's 00:30 AM and

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,000
tomorrow we have to get up very early
because we've played a game of grief.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,290
Well, at least Fede's been playing grief.
and I've played grief, well, half grief.

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,290
I played.

53
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,470
I think Fede has to start playing.
at 10:20 a.m. and I at 11 a.m..

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,470
is very ugly.

55
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,020
Conclusion: It is necessary to play better or to play in
Pro (Open), the Pro starts at 12 o'clock

56
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,020
in the morning.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

57
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,180
It's true that it costs 20€ more to sign up
to Pro, but listen, what you're taking to say:

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,570
"I don't have to sleep 7-5 hours, maybe 6.
hours..."

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,160
But what are you talking about, man, if it's the
00:30!

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
Come on, okay, I'm going to sleep 8 hours...

61
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,980
If we can get up at 8:30 a.m. and throw away
up and we still have
