1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,229
Moien!

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,200
Which is "good morning" in Luxembourgish.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,839
I came here today to play a disc field.
golf to Luxembourg and has some baskets to

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,839
pretty.

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:11,989
To bonitos.

6
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:16,730
Handmade, there, with wood and rubber
up here.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,730
To bonito.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,910
And it's a small, 8-hole field.

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,480
And in truth the first I believe that they are 30
meters, but I don't know, to see how it is

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
the thing.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,689
The field is on the side of a mountain... on the side
of a castle, on a hill with a castle,

12
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,970
that you can't see, but it's back there, okay?

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,120
And nothing, here in a little forest.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,250
I'm here, I've come with my family.

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,250
Steffie!

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:52,629
Let's see how it goes.

17
00:00:52,629 --> 00:01:25,330
We started, not Depart.

18
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:36,230
1.

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,420
And this counts as valid.

20
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,420
Ha!

21
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,450
Well, from here on, I record myself.
because this is already a little difficult to access.

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,870
with cart and everything but... hole 4, from here
all the way over there.

23
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,560
Hole 5, here going up a little bit,
don't you?

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,650
It looks... back there.

25
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,650
With lots of trees.

26
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,560
It's a nice place to be, but there's no room for
put on a disc golf course, i.e...

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Hole 6.

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,210
Climbing up, with a handful of trees
in between.

29
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,210
I mean.

30
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,250
How do you get up there?

31
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,250
What do you mean?

32
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,250
What do you mean?

33
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,130
You gotta be a little lucky, uh... thing.
that I haven't had, but well, what do you know?

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,130
he's going to do.

35
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,470
The truth is, I mean, a lot of holes are like that,
but wow, you can take the easy 3.

36
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,519
Let's see, and you want it not, the field is super
picturesque, eh.

37
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,629
I mean, it's nice.

38
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:40,160
And nothing, so we go to the next one, that is,
That's really just 10 holes, that's 6 coming up.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,230
up and down four.

40
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,249
So nothing, we go on!

41
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:47,569
Hole 7, which is just around the corner.

42
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,489
It's to funny because the same thing you find
holes with pechÃ¡ of trees by means that

43
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,749
you find this, pull!

44
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:56,080
hole 8.

45
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,939
An approach.

46
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:01,939
And inside.

47
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:09,010
It's to funny because if it hits the chains
the disc can still come out hovering around

48
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,010
the side.

49
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:16,719
Hole 9, goes from here to there, in the middle.
of all the trees.

50
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,549
Eye to the shot..

51
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:24,950
You don't see shit, but there's a point.
green that is my disc and the thing of above is the

52
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,950
basket.

53
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,950
Here you go.

54
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,560
Toooooma ya eh!

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Gorgeous!

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,019
The baskets are cool, huh?

57
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,239
They've worked it well because they've put it on.
Like, hey, this is the 3rd hole for

58
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,409
up and this is the 10th hole down.

59
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:44,319
And that basket over there is the one with the 2nd hole and the
of 9.

60
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,799
I mean, it's a path you go up and down.

61
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,799
Hole 10.

62
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,870
The basket is right in front of me,
but behind all that, I mean, either hit or hit.

63
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,299
that piece of curve or what I've done,
a tomahawk in the middle and cross all the trees.

64
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,459
And see where I've fallen, which I think
has hit the road and has gone out hovering

65
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,590
to get the hell out of here.

66
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,609
And this is the 10th hole, and the 10th hole.
1, both at once.

67
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:16,290
And I have landed here, which is more or less
to play the hole 1 again.

68
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:29,920
Well, that's it, I'm done playing the field,
I mean, it's funny, you want it not with the

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,810
you look so pretty, don't you?

70
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,750
It's true that there are very easy holes, that is,
that you say, "this is an approach," for example,

71
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,890
like the one on the first hole, which is very easy.
and then there are holes that are crossing in the middle of

72
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,390
trees, there's no road, there's no hole.

73
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,490
I mean, there's no place to throw away, which is a
little "shoot to see what comes out," but well, it's

74
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,700
Well, I mean... the biggest field
of Luxembourg.

75
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,980
You don't see this every day.

76
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,710
So nothing, I'll see you next time.

77
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,910
I'll see you later.
