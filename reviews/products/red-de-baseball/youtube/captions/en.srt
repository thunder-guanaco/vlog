Hello!

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,160
Today I'm going to show you a very cool thing that
I've been given for my birthday which is

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,740
a baseball net.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,190
Why is it so cool for us,
we who play disc golf?

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:18,339
We can use it to warm up, to train,
to record us and see how we're moving.

6
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:19,920
and a lot of other things.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,010
So, let's get into it, let's build it up
and I'll show you how it works.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,460
It's very simple.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,920
Well, as you've seen, it is built really fast
and directly warm up.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,640
Let's start with a forehand.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey, not bad... let's go in the middle... and another one.

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,980
A little backhand shots.

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,320
I'm slipping!

14
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,160
(Manolo off) And does that hold with a fast throw?

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,460
Well, let's hit it, with a driver, super hard.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,900
Looks like it. How do you see it?

17
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:33,940
So, I use it to warm up, to record me
and see how I'm moving, if I am

18
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,430
doing right or wrong or for example pointing,
for example to say that I have a hole there

19
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,690
that I have to hit at forty meters, then
Same thing, you have a square here and you want

20
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,110
it's too good to aim.

21
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,950
And if you get bored of throwing against the net then
you throw against the basket, don't you?

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,960
Ufff... if this comes out in the video... it's huge.

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,740
And that's it, that was the little review.

24
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:06,940
Very short, very fast, but well, that's what
that there is, it's really cool and nothing, like always,

25
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,840
share it, subscribe to it, give us love for
Everywhere, send it everywhere, you guys.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,270
send it to your grandmother via SMS, 
you send it, and nothing, until the

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,240
next, thank you for seeing us!
